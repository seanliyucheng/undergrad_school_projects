    "1. `count null`: The number of missing values for the zip code.\n",
    "2. `count non null`: The number of present values for the zip code.\n",

    "Let's figure out which restaurants had the worst scores ever (single lowest score). Let's start by creating a new dataframe called `ins_named`. It should be exactly the same as `ins`, except that it should have the name and address of every business, as determined by the `bus` dataframe. If a `business_id` in `ins` does not exist in `bus`, the name and address should be given as NaN.\n",

    "What's the relationship between the first and second scores for the businesses with 2 inspections in a year? Do they typically improve? For simplicity, let's focus on only 2016 for this problem, using `ins2016` data frame that will be created for you below. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, make a dataframe called `scores_pairs_by_business` indexed by `business_id` (containing only businesses with exactly 2 inspections in 2016).  This dataframe contains the field `score_pair` consisting of the score pairs **ordered chronologically**  `[first_score, second_score]`. \n",

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",
